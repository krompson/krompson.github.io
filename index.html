 <p>Hey, I'm Kristi! I enjoy helping people find the magical sweet spot of exceptional work, and having fun doing it. When I'm not working, I like to travel, get outside, read, and watch 90s sitcoms.</p>

        <h3>Customer Support Team</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://www.helpscout.com/" target="_blank" class="body-links">Help Scout</a>, 2017-present</h4>
<p><q>Goddess of Google Calendar, master of proactive helpfulness who consistently makes something out of nothing, hilarious earth angel who helps everyone feel included and welcome. Both the structure of our team and our immediate day-to-day work are stronger and better equipped for life and tragedy and discussions because of you. We are super fortunate to be in your presence. If you were my SaaS product I would call you 'thoughtful, sharp, and innovative'--but since you are my human friend I call you 'I love you, donâ€™t ever change'!!!</q></p>
      <p>-Paola Maciel, Support Team, Help Scout</p>      
<p><q>I find her to be one of the top examples of somebody who's a wonderful culture add at Help Scout. Not only is she pretty much running with the Whole Company Support program at Help Scout, she does tons of things with regard to retreats, and there are all sorts of little things she's doing to serve and delight her teammates, to encourage them, to make them better, that to me, embody being a net culture add, probably much more so than I am myself.</q></p>
      <p>-Nick Francis, CEO, Help Scout</p>
      <h3>Customer Success Lead</h3>
        <h4><a href="https://www.cartstack.com/" target="_blank" class="body-links">CartStack</a>, 2015-2017</h4>
      <p><q>We love working with Kristi.  She's super bright and I can tell she really takes pride in her work.  I'm so glad she's on the team and that she actually loves the work.  It's been great to coach her because she picks up on things so quickly.  It makes my job easier for sure!</q></p>

      <p><q>I find Mrs. Thompson to be one of the most, if not the most, responsible, caring, sincere and willing person I have met. She believes in herself and always presents herself in a confident manner with an air of modesty that makes her approachable and well-liked by all she comes in contact with. Mrs. Thompson is a motivated woman of numerous talents and considerable self-motivation. She can also be fun-loving, likable, and trustworthy.</q></p>

      <h3>Wedding Coordinator</h3>
<h4>Freelance, 2013-2018</h4>
      <p><q>I am considering hiring Kristi to be my every day coordinator! I can only imagine how much more productive I would be if I had her by my side. The amount of stress she took off our backs makes her well worth the money. Anything and everything we needed help with, she was on it. We gave Kristi our vision and timeline, and she made sure that everything was perfect. She handled any and all requests with efficiency and a smile. Honestly, hiring Kristi was the best decision that we made throughout the entire wedding planning process.</q></p>
          <p>-Steven Jones, Groom</p>
      <h3>Dog Sitter</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.rover.com/members/kristi-t-247-care-while-working-from-home/" target="_blank" class="body-links">Rover</a>, 2015-Present</h4>
      <p><q>Kristi is just the best! She's super reliable, very good with communication, and such a dog lover. She made sure to keep the dogs' training routine, she sent us picture updates (even taking the pups to go see a parade!), and she left the house perfect when she left; trash was taken out, sheets and towels washed, the whole shebang! I'd definitely recommend her for dog and house sitting.</q></p>
